# Magic Square

A magic square is a two-dimensional array of positive unique integers such that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same constant. The following is an example of a magic square whose constant is 34:

    16 	3 	2 	13  
    5 	10 	11 	8  
    9 	6 	7 	12  
    4 	15 	14 	1  

Your assignment is to complete the ```isMagicSquare``` method in the ```MagicSquare``` class. This method should test the two dimensional array and return either ```true``` or ```false``` (whether it is or is not a magic square). Feel free to write several private helper methods to help you along the way if you wish.
